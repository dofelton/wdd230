            <p>Visual Hierarchy is a design principle that arranges elements according to importance. Characteristics such as size, font, color and contrast are used to portray importance. On this website you can see at the top they use large pictures and headings to show importance and furhter down when you see the schedule they do not use pictures and the font size is much smaller.</p>

            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <h3>National Geographic</h3>

            <img src="/lesson02/images/thirds.jpg" alt="Image of the top of the National Geographic homepage" >
            <p>The "Rule of Thirds" divides the visual area into thirds vertically and horizontally. Focal elements are placed where these lines intersect. In the opening image that is shown one element is shown on the right hand third axis and another is shown at the intersection of the left and bottom third lines.</p>

            <h2>PARC: Contrast</h2>
            <h3>CNN</h3>
            <h3><a href="https://www.cnn.com/">CNN</a></h3>

            <img src="/lesson02/images/contrast2.jpg" alt="Image of the middle of CNN homepage" >
            <p>The PARC system is used to create better and more efficient designs. PARC stands for proximity, alignment, repetition and Contrast. The use of contrast is to make dis-similar elements very different using colors, sizes and shapes. CNN uses a white background and black text as a contrast. Also the headlines are large and the text under the image is smaller to contrast size drawing attention to the headline.</p>
